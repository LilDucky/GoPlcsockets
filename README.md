testtcp.go runs a few tests using Typed file, Logical file and CIF file functions.
Code to receive PLC messages will be added soon - Computer server / PLC client
Testing has been done only on a Micrologix 1400 but should work on a SLC 550 with minor modifications
The IP addresses are hard coded. Code should be modified to fit your IP addresses
